Here is a structured course outline on the topic "Data Structures & Algorithms":

**Course Name:** Fundamentals of Data Structures & Algorithms

**Module 1: Introduction to Data Structures**

* Summary: This module introduces students to the basics of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Students will learn how to represent and manipulate these data structures in a programming language.
* Topics:
	+ Definition and characteristics of different data structures
	+ How to implement and use each data structure

**Module 2: Sorting & Searching Algorithms**

* Summary: This module covers fundamental algorithms for sorting and searching data, including linear search, binary search, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and more.
* Topics:
	+ Introduction to sorting and searching algorithms
	+ Analysis of time and space complexity for each algorithm

**Module 3: Graph Algorithms**

* Summary: This module introduces students to graph data structures and algorithms, including graph traversal, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and topological sorting.
* Topics:
	+ Representation of graphs (adjacency matrices, adjacency lists)
	+ Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms
	+ Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm)

**Module 4: Algorithm Design & Analysis**

* Summary: This module focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms, including big-O notation, time and space complexity, and trade-offs between these factors.
* Topics:
	+ Introduction to algorithm design principles
	+ Big-O notation and time complexity analysis
	+ Space complexity analysis

**Module 5: Advanced Data Structures**

* Summary: This module explores more advanced data structures, such as hash tables, heaps, and balanced trees (AVL trees, red-black trees).
* Topics:
	+ Introduction to hash tables and their applications
	+ Heaps and priority queues
	+ Balanced trees and their properties

**Module 6: Advanced Algorithms**

* Summary: This module covers advanced algorithms for solving complex problems, including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.
* Topics:
	+ Introduction to dynamic programming principles
	+ Dynamic programming examples (Fibonacci sequence, longest common subsequence)
	+ Greedy algorithms and backtracking

This course outline provides a comprehensive foundation in data structures and algorithms, covering both basic and advanced topics.
